# gridmap
A pack to create a 2.5D map that can do ray casting/shooting.

## Requirements

### Map creation

**Generate** a map, with a few parameters to determine cluster size,
prevalence...

**Import** a map from some file format. Should be easy to use with a height map,
e.g. from satellite images.

### Ray casting/shooting

true or false if an obstacle was hit.
